[**Description of this repository**]<br>
This is a Jupyter Notebook that shows Descriptive Statistics examples, using Python, Pandas, NumPy and Matplotlib, along with Anaconda managed environments.

[**Source Code and Run**]<br>
Source code available at github.com, through the following link:<br>
[https://github.com/danielpm1982/sample-jupyter-notebook-statistics](https://github.com/danielpm1982/sample-jupyter-notebook-statistics) <br>
The source code includes the Jupyter Notebooks .ipynb files themselves (one for each example), static resources - as images, .csv data files, as well as the environment.yml file, 
which can be used to generate an Anaconda environment for running this project locally (don't forget to customize the env paths to your own filesystem and OS when creating the environment).<br>
You can also run this Jupiter Notebook project remotely at [https://colab.research.google.com/notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/notebook), importing the content directly 
from this github repository to your Google Drive (using Colab platform), without having to create any Anaconda environment locally. In this case, use the .ipynb colab version instead 
(the paths were updated for accessing remote resources).
